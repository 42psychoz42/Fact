# Fact
Fact's programming language repository

Fact is an esoteric programming language. This was done for fun and because of joke about "Fact's language".
It's version with IDE for codding.
In IDE you can:
- write, save and run code
- see outputs
- open instruction in additinal window
- create new script files
- change current script file
- set inputs
- convert numbers to numbers / char to char code / text to text code into script


Default script is "Hello, World!" script.

# How to work with Fact
Fact prog. lang. has 32 commands, you can use them by intering it's index number in script in binary number system.
You can divide commands by using spaces or by moving to next line, as you want.
Fact is stack prog. lang., so you have stack and you can operate with it.
You also can make new stacks (also named mem stacks).
Instruction has discription about every command, so use it!
If you have some issues or questions, you can use github or just write me in Discord (psychoz42).

So, instruction and this essay may have some factual (unlikely) and grammar errors, so write me about it and i will correct or add some information!

You can use this language (good luck, heh) like you want (please adequately).

Maybe later i'll upload just compiller without IDE and I also have some ideas to make Fact+ with 64 commands!
